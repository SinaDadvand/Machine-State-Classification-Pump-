# Machine-State-Classification-Pump-
Classification model for a pump status based on Sensor output

In this notebook we are going to try and train a classifier to predict the state of a pump based on the sensors output. We have selected Logistic Regression as our classifier. Since the results for classification seemed too good to be true, we also tried oversampling and test-validation-train methods alongside usual test-train workflow.
